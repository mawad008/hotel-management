/// A room the guest has chosen for a stay, ready to be handed to the future
/// Reservation phase.
///
/// This is deliberately **not** a reservation: nothing has been sent to the
/// backend, no hold is placed, no price is finalised. It captures exactly what
/// the Reservation phase will need to build its request:
///
/// * the hotel ([hotelId] + a display name snapshot),
/// * the room **type** ([roomType]) — the backend baseline requires
///   `room_type_id` and treats `room_id` as nullable, so [roomId] stays `null`
///   until the backend exposes physical-room allocation,
/// * the [stay] and [party],
/// * a [nightlyRate] price snapshot taken from the discovery model at selection
///   time (no taxes, fees or dynamic pricing — the approved baseline uses simple
///   pricing).
